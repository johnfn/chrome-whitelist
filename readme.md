# chrome-whitelist
This is a Chrome extension that only lets you access sites that will help you get work done.

## Installation

is pretty easy. 

* `git clone` the repository
* Go to chrome://extensions
* press "Load unpacked extension..."
* Navigate to the extension and load it. 
* Done

One day, when I feel like wasting $5 I may put it on the extension store. That day is not today.
