# chrome-whitelist
This is a Chrome extension that only lets you access sites that will help you get work done. It's smart enough that if you add, say, `google.com`, you can also access sites that google searches link to.

## Installation

is pretty easy. 

* `git clone` the repository
* Go to chrome://extensions
* press "Load unpacked extension..."
* Navigate to the extension and load it. 
* Done

One day, when I feel like wasting $5 I may put it on the extension store (did you know putting stuff in the extension store costs $5? Yup.). That day is not today.

## Todo

* Visual interface for unblocked sites (right now it's just an array in javascript)
* On/off switch. (Right now, the only way to turn it off is to disable the extension...heh.
* Some sort of counter to show how productive you've been. Instead of negativity, have some sort of positive "you've spent 5 hours being productive today! Look how productive you've been over the week..."
